if 0 <= marks <= 49: #this line is made to check if the marks are outside the valid range given (0 to 100)
    print("FAIL") #this line is used to print 'FAIL' is the condition is true.
elif 50 <= marks <= 64: #this line is used to check if the value of 'marks' is between 50 and 64. And the 'elif' means else if, and is only checked if the previous condition range 'if' was false.

    print("DIST") #this line prints 'DIST' if the condition is true.
elif marks >= 85: #this line is the condition that checks the value of 'marks' is 85 or better.

else: #this line is used to check the condition if none of the previous if or elif condition were true.
    print("Invalid marks") #this line is used to print 'Invalid marks' if none of the conditions were met. in this case (0-100) marks
